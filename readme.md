# Project Overview

Below is a summary of each Task:

## 1. Variational Autoencoder with KL Divergence Loss
   - Utilized a variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture with KL divergence loss to reconstruct data.

## 2. Jets as Graphs
   - Converted images to point cloud format.
   - Generated edges using k-nearest neighbors (KNN) graph.
   - Classified graphs using a graph convolutional network (GCN).

## 3. Diffusion Model for Fast Detector Simulation
   - Implemented a diffusion model with a Time Conditioned UNet and DDPM scheduler to generate images.

## 4. Graph Transformer for Fast Detector Simulation
   - Utilized a vision transformer for image classification of quarks and gluons.
   - Used convolutional upsampling as a decoder to generate images.

## 5. Optimal Transport for HEP
   - Employed MNIST digits 1 and 9 for the dataset.
   - Implemented an autoencoder with latent dimensions mapping to a normal distribution for reconstructing digit images.
   - Utilized Sinkhorn loss for optimal transport.
   - Extended the model for quarks/gluon dataset image generation.
